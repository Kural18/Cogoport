Additional Doubts:- 
1. Don't know how to get the background picture of the ship which is present in the starting along with the video.
2. Didn't know how to do curve styling before subscribe newsletter in the footer.
3. Didn't know how to change navbar responsive.
4. Didn't know how to change the "products, partners" footer responsive and add contact us.
5. The background appears when I touch the video, doesn't look like automated.
6. Bit difficult to make things responsive.

Things not done since I though JS is required:-
1. Navbar changing color when scrolling.
2. Navbar items dropdown not working. 
3.  Whatsapp contact us coming on the right side of the screen when scrolled when scrolled
